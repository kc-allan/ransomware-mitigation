# Ransomware Mitigation System

Welcome to the **Ransomware Mitigation System** repository! This project is designed to protect healthcare data centers from ransomware attacks by utilizing containerization and immutable infrastructure. By isolating applications into secure containers and ensuring that the infrastructure remains immutable, this system effectively reduces the risk of data compromise.

## Introduction

Ransomware attacks pose a significant threat to the healthcare industry, where data integrity and availability are crucial. This system leverages containerization to isolate applications and immutable infrastructure to prevent unauthorized changes, offering a robust defense against ransomware attacks.

## Features

- **Containerization**: Applications are isolated within secure containers, minimizing the attack surface.
- **Immutable Infrastructure**: Infrastructure is deployed in a way that prevents unauthorized changes, ensuring consistency and security.
- **Automated Backups**: Regular, automated backups of critical data to ensure quick recovery in case of an attack.
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Continuous monitoring of container operations with detailed logs for audit and analysis.
- **File Integrity Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of file integrity to detect any unauthorized modifications.

## System Architecture

The system is designed with the following components:

1. **Containerized Applications**: Each application is deployed in its own container, isolating it from the rest of the system.
2. **Immutable Infrastructure**: The underlying infrastructure is designed to be immutable, meaning once deployed, it cannot be altered.
3. **Backup Service**: A dedicated service for creating and storing backups securely.
4. **Monitoring & Logging Service**: Continuous monitoring and logging of container activities to detect and respond to any anomalies.

## Installation

To install and set up the system, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/kc-allan/ransomware-mitigation.git
   cd ransomware-mitigation
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set Up Containers**:
   Use the provided Docker files to build and deploy your application containers.
   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. **Configure Backup and Monitoring Services**:
   Adjust the configuration files to fit your environment.

5. **Deploy the System**:
   Follow the deployment guide provided in the documentation to deploy the immutable infrastructure.

## Usage

1. **Access the System**:
   - Navigate to the system's dashboard to monitor container activities, view logs, and manage backups.

2. **Manage Containers**:
   - View the list of available container images and manage container operations directly from the system dashboard.

3. **Monitor Logs**:
   - Access detailed logs of container operations, including file uploads, via the dedicated logs page.

4. **Backup Management**:
   - Schedule and manage backups through the system, ensuring all critical data is securely stored.
